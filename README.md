### Steps to take

- [ ] 1. Design the Kanban Board UI
     Understand Kanban Board Structure: A Kanban board typically consists of columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) and cards (tasks).
     Create a Simple Layout:
     Start with a basic HTML/CSS mockup of the board using a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.
     Implement a grid layout for the columns.
     Create a Card Component:
     Design a card component that will hold individual tasks. Use a placeholder for now.
- [ ] 2. Implement React Components
     Break Down the Board into Components:
     Create reusable components like Board, Column, and Card.
     State Management:
     Use React state to manage the cards and columns. Start simpleâ€”just add and display cards in columns.
- [ ] 3. Add Drag-and-Drop Functionality
     Learn About React DnD: Explore the react-beautiful-dnd library to add drag-and-drop functionality.
     Implement Drag-and-Drop:
     Allow users to drag cards between columns.
     Handle the state updates when a card is moved.
- [ ] 4. Persist Data
     Local State Persistence:
     Start with local state management, but consider persisting data using localStorage.
     Explore Basic Back-End Integration:
     If comfortable, set up a simple API in Next.js to save and load board data.
- [ ] 5. Add Basic Interactivity
     Add/Edit/Delete Cards:
     Implement basic CRUD operations for the cards.
     Styling and Responsiveness:
     Improve the UI with better styling and ensure the board is responsive.
- [ ] 6. Refine and Expand
     Refine the UI: Polish the design and user experience. Add animations or transitions if desired.
     Add More Features: Consider adding features like filtering, searching, or assigning labels to cards.
- [ ] 7. Test and Deploy
     Test Your App: Test for bugs and usability.
     Deploy to Vercel: Deploy your Next.js app to Vercel for free.
- [ ] 8. Learn and Iterate
     Review Your Code: Take time to review and refactor your code if needed.
     Plan Next Features: Think about additional features or improvements.
